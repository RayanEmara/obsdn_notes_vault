## Sobolev spaces and initial derivation for discrete domains

$C^*$ are banach spaces but not *Hilbert* spaces (i.e. we cannot use Lax-Milgram).

In order to be talking sense (i.e. having a legal formulation) this is enough. We will end up with a weak formulation satisfying these properties.
- $(u,u',f)\in L^2$

Keep in mind that $L^2$ contains discontinuous functions.

$H^1$ is the simplest one dimensional Sobolev space. We are going to change the dimensionality of the space, the order of the derivative and the summability of the space. 
Can we strengthen the assumptions on the hypotheses on our solution if we strengthen those on $f\in L^2$ ? Answer is yes but we'll get there.

Note that the closure with respect to the $L^2$ norm has special properties, specifically:
$$
\overline{\mathcal{D}(I)}^{L^2(I)} = L^2(I)
$$
This is because $\mathcal{D}(I)$ is dense in $L^2(I)$, , meaning that the space of *smooth enough* functions with a compact support within the boundaries of $I$ is dense in $L^2$. If you think about it this makes sense since these functions would be $L^\infty$ (i think...).

Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be Hilbert spaces such that:
$$
H_1 \subset H_2 \qquad (H^1 \subset L^2 , \ H^1_0 \subset L^2)
$$
Any Hilbert space is the dual of itself:
$$
H_1' \approx H_1
$$
$$
H_2' \approx H_2
$$
Therefore if $H_1\subset H_2$ and $H_2'\subset H_1'$ (since a smaller Hilbert space will have a larger number of linear and continuous functionals, this is taken straight from notes I don't condone this behaviour):
$$
H_2\subset H_1
$$
But this is absurd, look at the hypothesis !
There's clearly a mistake somewhere and that mistake lies in the assumption that we can use both isomorphisms at the same time, which isn't true due to the **Riesz representation theorem** (1.5.5).

This a sort of representation for linear and continuous functionals over $H^1_0(I)$.

Now suppose that $f_0 = 0$ :
$$
<F,v> =\int_I f_1v' \underbrace{=}_{IBP} -\int_I f_1'v
$$
but this basically means $F=-f_1'$. 

...

Not so fast bucko, this is an illegal move since $f_1 \in L^2$ so we don't know its derivative necessarily.
We, on the other hand, can say (by defining it as such) that :
$$
F = -f_1'
$$
Implies that $F$ has $-1$ derivative in $L^2$.
