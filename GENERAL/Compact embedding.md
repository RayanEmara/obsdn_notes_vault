Given the definition of [[Continuous embedding | continuous embedding]]. We say that the embedding $X \subset Y$ is **compact** if 
$$
x_n \mathop{\longrightarrow}^{X} x \Longrightarrow x_n \mathop{\longrightarrow}^Y x
$$
We generally use the following shorthand to refer to this situation:
$$
X \subset \subset Y
$$
