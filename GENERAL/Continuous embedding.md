Let $X$ and $Y$ be two Hilbert spaces such that $X\subset Y$.
We say that $X$ is **continuously embedded** in $Y$ if there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that:
$$
\|x\|_Y \leq C \|x\|_X \quad \forall x \in X  
$$
This essentially means that the norm of $Y$ nicely controls that of $X$.

Continuous embeddings between Sobolev spaces are essential for proving existence and regularity results for solutions of PDEs.
