We call **tempered distribution** any linear functional
$$
\Lambda \colon \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \mathbb{R}
$$
(Where $\mathcal{S}$ is the space of [[Schwartz functions]]) which is continuous in the sense that 
$$
\Lambda(\phi_k) \to \Lambda(\phi)
$$
For every sequence  $\{ \phi_k \}$ such that 
$$
\phi_k \mathop{\longrightarrow}^{\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)} \phi 
$$
The space of **tempered distributions** is denoted by $\mathcal{S'}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
