## Generic derivation
Given an observation $o$ we can write it as
$$
o = v \pm err
$$
where $v$ is our measured value and $err$ is the instrument tolerance
$$
\log_b(o) = \log_b(v + err)
$$
by differentiating the error portion we get the general formula for any base $b$ logarithim
$$
\log_b(o)= \log_b(v) \pm \frac   {1}{\ln(b)} \frac{err}{v}
$$
