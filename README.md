## Introduction
This is my Obsidian - notes vault, it's where I keep all my university notes and its respective environment. 

If you're here for the notes, go to the [exports folder](https://github.com/RayanEmara/obsdn_notes_vault/tree/master/exports).

2. Using your favourite terminal, navigate to your preferred folder using`cd` and run the following command:
 `git clone https://github.com/RayanEmara/obsdn_notes_vault`
3. You can now open the vault using Obsidian and get started.
