## Sobolev spaces and initial derivation for discrete domains
$C^*$ are banach spaces but not *Hilbert* spaces (i.e. we cannot use Lax-Milgram).

In order to be talking sense (i.e. having a legal formulation) this is enough. We will end up with a weak formulation satisfying these properties.
- $(u,u',f)\in L^2$

Keep in mind that $L^2$ contains discontinuous functions.

$H^1$ is the simplest one dimensional [[Sobolev space | sobolev]] space. We are going to change the dimensionality of the space, the order of the derivative and the summability of the space. 
Can we strengthen the assumptions on the hypotheses on our solution if we strengthen those on $f\in L^2$ ? Answer is yes but we'll get there.

Note that the closure with respect to the $L^2$ norm has special properties, specifically:
$$
\overline{\mathcal{D}(I)}^{L^2(I)} = L^2(I)
$$
This is because $\mathcal{D}(I)$ is dense in $L^2(I)$, , meaning that the space of *smooth enough* functions with a compact support within the boundaries of $I$ is dense in $L^2$. If you think about it this makes sense since these functions would be $L^\infty$ (i think...).

Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be Hilbert spaces such that:
$$
H_1 \subset H_2 \qquad (H^1 \subset L^2 , \ H^1_0 \subset L^2)
$$
Any Hilbert space is the dual of itself:
$$
H_1' \approx H_1
$$
$$
H_2' \approx H_2
$$
Therefore if $H_1\subset H_2$ and $H_2'\subset H_1'$ (since a smaller Hilbert space will have a larger number of linear and continuous functionals, this is taken straight from notes I don't condone this behaviour):
$$
H_2\subset H_1
$$
But this is absurd, look at the hypothesis !
There's clearly a mistake somewhere and that mistake lies in the assumption that we can use both isomorphisms at the same time, which isn't true due to the **Riesz representation theorem** (1.5.5).

This a sort of representation for linear and continuous functionals over $H^1_0(I)$.

Now suppose that $f_0 = 0$ :
$$
<F,v> =\int_I f_1v' \underbrace{=}_{IBP} -\int_I f_1'v
$$
but this basically means $F=-f_1'$. 

...

Not so fast bucko, this is an illegal move since $f_1 \in L^2$ so we don't know its derivative necessarily.
We, on the other hand, can say (by defining it as such) that :
$$
F = -f_1'
$$
Implies that $F$ has $-1$ derivative in $L^2$.

## The $\mathbb{R}^n$ case
We'll take a domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to be an open set, for example $\partial\Omega$.
>[!example] 
>$$
>\Omega = \{ (x,y) \in [0,1]^2 \ , \ x,y \in \mathbb{Q} \}
>$$
>$$
>\partial\Omega = [0,1]^2
>$$

Our main assumptions will be that $\Omega$ has to be an open set and $\partial\Omega$ smooth. Let's say we want $\partial\Omega \in C^1$, it can be constructed as the union of locally $C^1$ functions. (3.1.2)

Now we want to define $H^1(\Omega)$ (we'll worry about the boundary later on).

>[!definition] Weak derivative in $\mathbb{R}^n$
>The $i$-th weak derivative $w =\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}$ of $u$ is such that:
>$$
>\int_{\Omega} u \ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_i} = \int_{\Omega} w \ v \qquad \forall v \in \mathbb{D}(I)
>$$

>[!definition] Sobolev space (6.,2.11)
>Let $\Omega \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be an open set, the Sobolev space $H^1$ is defined as:
>$$
> H^1(\Omega) = \left\{ u \in L^2(\Omega) \ ; \ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \in L^2(\Omega) \qquad \forall i = 1,..,n \right\}
>$$

(6.2.12)
Given $u \in H^2(\Omega)$:
 We take $$H^1(\Omega) \approx L^2(\Omega)^{n+1}$$ 
 Meaning we take these spaces to be  isomorphic.
 
 We define the gradient as :
  $$\nabla u = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \\ .. \\ .. \end{bmatrix} \in L^2(\Omega)^n$$
  
  We define the norm to be:
  $$| \nabla u |^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}  \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \right)$$
  
Taking derivative in the classical sense:
$$
\left(u  \in C^1(\Omega) \bigcap L^2(\Omega)\right) \land \left(u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \in L^2(\Omega) \right) \Longrightarrow u \in H^1(\Omega)
$$
Moreover the classical partial derivatives coincides with the weak ones, additionally if $\Omega$ is bounded:
$$
\Longrightarrow C^1(\overline{\Omega}) \subset H^1(\Omega)
  $$
We finally define the bilinear form on $H^1$ to be:
$$
(u,v)_{H^1} = \int_\Omega \left( u \cdot v + \nabla u \times\nabla v \right)
$$
Where the first is a product between two scalar functions and the second is a scalar product (sum of $n+1$ terms). 
The former will be sometimes omitted.

We can define a norm (6.2.13) therefore

## The $H^k$ spaces
We basically take 6.2.11 and apply it a bunch of times to define higher order weak derivatives.

A problem now arises, how do we define the value of a function $u \in H^s(\Omega)$ on the boundary ? Remember these functions are defined up to a negligible set.

## Embeddings theorems
In this section we will make use of [[Continuous embedding  | embeddings]] in order to evaluate the regularity of $H^s(\Omega)$ elements.

>[!theorem] Sobolev Theorem (6.6.1)
> Let $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$ or an open set wiht *Lipschitz* boundary. Let $s \geq 0$, then the following [[Continuous embedding | continuous embeddings]] hold:
> $$
> H^s(\Omega) \subset \begin{cases} 
> L^p(\Omega) \quad \forall \ 2 \leq p \leq \frac{2n}{n-2s} \quad \text{if } n >2s \\
> L^p(\Omega) \quad \forall \ 2 \leq p \leq \infty \qquad  \ \text{if } n = 2s \\
> C^0(\overline{\Omega}) \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \qquad \qquad \text{if } n < 2s 
> 
> \end{cases}
> $$
> So if we increase $s$ we increase the regularity but we also have to take into account $n$ (the number of dimensions). 
> >Theorem 6.6.1 ensures the continuity of the elements of $H^1(\Omega)$ when $n = 1$, while if $n = 2$, the fact that a function belongs to $H^1(\Omega)$ is not any more sufficient to guarantee its continuity. In the case $n = 2$, in order to have continuity of a function $u$ we have to assume that $u \in H^s(\Omega)$ with $s > 1$. We deduce that, as the space dimension increases, the regularity of the functions of $H^s(\Omega)$ decreases.
> 
> If $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is bounded then all of the above embeddings are [[Compact embedding | compact ]] except for:
> $$
> H^s(\Omega) \subset L^{\frac{2n}{n-2s}} \qquad \text{when } n > 2s
> $$

Here's a demonstration (example 6.6.5) of this theorem in action , assume the following:
- $n \geq 3$
- $\Omega$ unbounded
- $\big\{ u_m\big\} \subset H^1(\Omega)$ such that $\big\| u_m \big\|_{H^1(\Omega)} \leq c < \infty$

Thanks to theorem 1.4.13, we know that:
$$
\big\{ u_{m_k} \big\} \quad s.t. \quad u_{m_k}  \mathop{\longrightarrow}^{H^1(\Omega)}_{\text{weakly}} u \in H^1(\Omega)
$$
We can therefore conclude that the above sequence converges to $L^p \ \  \forall \ 2 \leq p \leq \frac{2n}{n-2s}$, formally:
$$
u_k , u \in L^p{\Omega} \ \ \text{and} \ \ u_k\mathop{\longrightarrow}^{L^p(\Omega)} u 
$$

### $H^s(\Omega)$ where $s < 0$
These spaces are defined extending definition [[APDE - Advanced Partial Differential Equations - F. Gazzola#Non-integer $H k$ | 6.4.1]].
>[!definition] Negative non-integer Sobolev spaces (6.7)
>Let $s < 0$
>$$H^s(\mathbb{R}^n) = \big\{ u \in \mathcal{S'}(\mathbb{R}^n) \ ; \ (1 + |\xi|^2)^{\frac{s}{2}} \hat{u}(\xi) \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \big\}$$
>Where $\mathcal{S'}$ is the complex space of [[Tempered distributions | tempered distributions]] (the dual for the space of fast decreasing functions).

If we let $k$ be an integer then we can define the following duality:
$$
H^{-k}(\Omega) = \big[ H^k_0(\Omega) \big]'
$$
We can also define the following Hilbert triple:
$$
H^k_0(\Omega) \subset L^2(\Omega) \subset H^{-k}(\Omega)
$$
At this point there's a lot of boilerplate that can honestly be studied far better in the book anyway, I won't bother writing it down since it's really just stuff that is gonna be referenced later. I'll include references to the book whenever needed.

## Weak solutions of partial differential equations
### Homogeneous Dirichlet problem
Let $\Omega$ be an open, bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$  and let its boundary $\partial \Omega \in C^1$. Take $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ , $f \in L^2(\Omega)$. 
We define the Homogeneous Dirichlet Problem (7.1) as:
$$
\begin{cases}
-\Delta u +  \alpha u &= f \qquad &&in  \ \Omega \\
u &=0 &&on\ \partial \Omega
\end{cases}
$$
If $f \in C^0 (\Omega)$ and $u \in C^2 (\Omega) \ \cap \ C^0 (\overline{\Omega})$ the equation is satisfied in the classical sense, meaning $u$ is a classical solution.

A **weak solution** on the other hand satisfies (7.1.1) $u \in H^1_0(\Omega)$ and:
$$
\int_{\Omega} \nabla u \nabla v + \alpha \int_{\Omega} uv = \int_{\Omega} fv \quad \forall v \in H^1_0(\Omega)
$$
If $u$ weak solution is $C^2 (\overline{\Omega})$ then you can easily conclude that it is also a classical solution.

>[!example] Important counter example
>If $n > 1$ then:
>$$
>\Delta u \in C^0 (\Omega) \ \centernot\Longrightarrow \  u \in C^2 (\Omega)
>$$
>In higher dimensional spaces it's wise to avoid formulating your problems using such regular spaces, prefer instead Sobolev spaces

>[!example] Remark (7.1.2)
>If $u$ is a classical solution of (7.1) then necessarily $f \in C^0 (\overline{\Omega})$. Therefore if $f$ is $L^2(\Omega)$ we cannot expect a weak solution to also be classical.

>[!theorem] Theorem (7.1.3)
>Let $\alpha \geq 0$ and $f \in L^2(\Omega)$ then there exists a *unique* solution $u \in H^1_0(\Omega)$ of 7.1 (the Homogeneous Dirichlet problem). 
>Moreover the unique solution is also the unique minimizer of $J(v)$:
>$$
>J(v) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega}\big(|\nabla v |^2 + \alpha v^2 \big) - \int_{\Omega} fv \quad v \in H^1_0(\Omega)
>$$
>The intuition for the "minimum" being unique is that this is basically a parabola.
>>[!theorem] Proof
>>We endow the Hilbert space $H^1_0(\Omega)$ with the following scalar product (6.2.18):
>>$$
>>(u,v)=\int_\Omega\nabla u\nabla v\quad\forall u,v\in H_0^1(\Omega).
>>$$
>>Given the assumption $a \geq 0$, the bilinera form:
>>$$
>>a(u,v)=\int_\Omega(\nabla u\nabla v+\alpha uv)\quad\forall u,v\in H_0^1(\Omega)
>>$$
>>is coercive over $H^1_0(\Omega)$.
>>Moreover the linear form $v \to \int_{\Omega}fv$ is continuous over $H^1_0(\Omega)$.
>>Then the assertion follows from the Lax-Milgram theorem.

It's interesting to note that what we wrote above doesn't necessarily break for $\alpha <0$, in fact, it *can* work. By the PoincarÃ¨ inequality there exists a constant $\lambda_1 > 0$ such that:
$$
\lambda_1 \|u \|^2_{L^2(\Omega)} \leq \|\nabla u\|^2_{L^2(\Omega)} \quad \forall u \in H^1_0(\Omega)
$$
Now....
$$
\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}(|\nabla u|^{2}+\alpha u^{2}) &=\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^{2}+\alpha\int_{\Omega}u^{2} \\
\text{(using PoincarÃ¨)}&\geq \int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^{2}-\frac{|\alpha|}{\lambda_1}\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^{2} \\
&=\frac{\lambda_{1}-|\alpha|}{\lambda_{1}}\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^{2}

\end{align}
$$

In fact if $\alpha < 0$:
$$
\alpha\lambda_{1}\|u\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}^{2}\geq\alpha\|\nabla u\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}^{2}=>\alpha\|u\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}^{2}\geq-\frac{|\alpha|}{\lambda_{1}}\|\nabla u\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}^{2}
$$
Meaning $\alpha$ just needs to be bigger than $-\lambda_1$ to retain coercivity.

There's a small tangent on FrÃ¨chet derivatives, there's no mention of it in the book so I'll avoid it, you can find references to it at page 17 of Ravizza's notes.
### Non Homogeneous Dirichlet problem
Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded open set of class $C^1$, we look for a function $u \colon \overline{\Omega} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
$$
\begin{cases}
-\Delta u +  \alpha u &= f \qquad &&in  \ \Omega \\
u &=g &&on\ \partial \Omega
\end{cases}
$$
with $f$ defined over $H^{-1} (\Omega)$, $g$ on $\ H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. If $g \in H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)$ we can use Theorem 6.5.3 to infer that:
$$
\exists \ u_0 \in H^1(\Omega) \ s.t. \ \gamma_0 u_0 = g
$$
We then define the following set which will aid in later constructions:
$$
K=\{v\in H^{1}(\Omega); v-u_{0}\in H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)\}
$$
>[!definition] Classical solution for NHDP (7.1.7)
>A classical solution for the NHDP is a function $u \in C^2 (\overline{\Omega})$ satisfying the NHDP.

>[!definition] Weak solution for the NHDP (7.1.7)
>A weak solution for the NHDP is a function $u \in K$ such that:
>$$
>\int_{\Omega}(\nabla u\nabla v+\alpha uv)=<f,v>\quad\forall v\in H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)
>$$
>Where $<f,v>$ is equal to $\int_{\Omega}fv$
>The same reasoning as HDP applies, therefore any classical solution is automatically also a weak solution, conversely any weak solution $u \in C^2 (\overline{\Omega})$ is also a classical solution.

We'll now analyse the existence of weak solutions

>Let $\alpha > -\lambda_1$ (where the eigenvalue is to be meant as the smallest eigenvalue under homogeneous Dirichlet conditions), $f \in H^{-1}(\Omega)$, $g \in H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega)$.

>Moreover $\overline{u}$ is a weak solution if and only if it minimizes the Dirichlet *energy* over $K$

>$$
>>[!theorem] Proof
>>The proof was given by the prof but it is way too long, it's far better to study it from the book, if need be you can also make use of Ravizza p.20 

### Non Homogeneous Neumann problem
Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded open set of class $C^1$, we look for a function $u $ satisfying:
$$
\begin{cases}-\Delta u+\alpha u&=f&&\Omega\\\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}&=g&&\partial\Omega\end{cases}
$$

with $f \in L^2(\Omega)$, $g \in H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega)$ and $(\alpha >0) \in \mathbb{R}$.

>[!definition] Classical solution for the NHNP (7.1.11)
>We define a classical solution one where the boundary conditions are to be meant $f \in C^0, g \in C^0$
>$$
>u\in C^{2}(\Omega)\cap C^{1}(\bar{\Omega})
>$$

>[!definition] Weak solution for the NHNP (7.1.11)
>Recalling that the trace operator "takes" half an order in terms of Sobolev regularity, take $g \in H^{\frac{1}{2}} (\partial\Omega)$. A weak solution is $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ such that:
>$$
>\int_{\Omega}(\nabla u\cdot\nabla v+\alpha uv)=\int_{\Omega}fv+\langle g,\gamma_{0}v\rangle \quad \forall v \in H^1(\Omega)
>$$
Where $\langle.,.\rangle$ denotes the duality between $H^{-\frac{1}{2}} (\partial\Omega)$ and $H^{\frac{1}{2}} (\partial\Omega)$ by way of theorem 6.5.3 (it's really important and mentioned a lot, make sure you understand it)

Let's now work on the regularity conditions, when is a regular weak solution also a classical one ? In order to do this let's assume $u \in C^2 (\overline{\Omega})$ is a weak solution for the NHNP, using the Gauss-Green formula (really we're just integrating by parts) we infer that 
$$
\int_{\Omega}(-\Delta u+\alpha u)v+\int_{\partial\Omega}\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}v=\langle g,v\rangle+\int_{\Omega}fv\quad\forall v\in C^1(\overline{\Omega}).
$$
If we take $v \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)$, meaning it has compact support
$$
\int_{\Omega}(-\Delta u+\alpha u)v=\int_{\Omega}fv\quad\forall v\in\mathcal{D}(\Omega)
$$
Which, as a consequence of 2.4.22, implies that
$$
-\Delta u+\alpha u=f \quad \mathrm{a.e. in}\  \Omega 
$$
Inserting this equation into the one we got from the Gauss-Green formula we get 
$$
\int_{\partial\Omega}\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}v=\langle g,v\rangle\quad\forall v\in C^1(\overline{\Omega}).
$$
The previous identity holds true for every $\nu\in H^1(\Omega)$, since $C^1(\overline{\Omega})$ is dense in $H^{1}(\Omega)$ and $\gamma_0:H^{1}(\Omega)\to H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)$ is a continuous surjective function. Hence we mav conclude that $\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}=g$ on $\partial\Omega$

We now want to prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution

>[!theorem] Existence and uniqueness of a NHNP weak solution
>Let $f \in L^{2}(\Omega),g\in H^{-1/2}(\partial\Omega)$ and $\alpha>0.$Then there exists a unique weak solution $u \in H^l( \Omega )$ Moreover, $u$ can be obtained as the solution of the following minimum problem
>$$
>\min_{v\in H^{1}(\Omega)}\left\{\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}(|\nabla v|^{2}+\alpha v^{2})-\int_{\Omega}fv-\langle g,\gamma_{0}v\rangle\right\}.
>$$
>>[!theorem] Proof
>>You can prove this by applying the Lax-Milgram theorem 1.7.4

Just like for homogeneous we want to explore what happens when we relax the $a > 0$ constraint
